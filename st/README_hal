These are the release notes for STMicroelectronics SensorHAL version 3.
Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about, explain how
to install the dynamic library, and what to do if something goes wrong.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

   Compiling, configuring and running the 3.x SensorHAL requires up-to-date
   versions of various software packages.

   Installing required packages: (used during `menuconfig`)
   $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev

   HAL require two headers file from linux kernel. File can be found under
   Documentation/iio-example-3.1x.y/. Copy files to linux/iio/


INSTALLING SOURCE CODE
   Copy HAL source code into hardware/STMicroelectronics/SensorHAL_IIO folder.
   During build process Android will include automatically the Android.mk.
   In your device.mk (device/{vendor}/{board}/device.mk) adds package build
   information:

   PRODUCT_PACKAGES += sensors.{TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM}

   Note: device.mk can not read $(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM) variable, read and
   replace the value from your BoardConfig.mk


CONFIGURING THE SENSOR HAL

--> Android Version < O
   From SensorHAL_IIO root folder:

   "mm sensors-defconfig"	Generated default hal_config file.

   "mm sensors-menuconfig"	Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.

   "mm sensors-cleanconf"	Delete hal_config, hal_config.old and configuration.h files.


--> Android Version >= O
   From SensorHAL_IIO root folder:

   "make -f Makefile_config sensors-defconfig"	Generated default hal_config file.

   "make -f Makefile_config sensors-menuconfig"	Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.

   "make -f Makefile_config sensors-cleanconf"	Delete hal_config, hal_config.old and configuration.h files.


--> Android Version pre-release
   From SensorHAL_IIO root folder:

   "PLATFORM_VERSION=x.y.z make -f Makefile_config sensors-defconfig"	Generated default hal_config file.

   "PLATFORM_VERSION=x.y.z make -f Makefile_config sensors-menuconfig"	Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.

   "PLATFORM_VERSION=x.y.z make -f Makefile_configsensors-cleanconf"	Delete hal_config, hal_config.old and configuration.h files.

    where x.y.z are related to Android pre-release version (see version_defaults.mk in <AOSP_TOP_DIR>/build/make/core/ path)


COMPILING THE SENSOR HAL CODE FOR ANDROID

--> From From SensorHAL_IIO root folder:

   "mm"			Build the code.

   "mm -B"		Force to rebuild all the code.

   "mm DEBUG=y"		Build SensorHAL in debug mode (no code optimization, generate map file).

--> From Android source code $TOP folder:
   Just build Android source code as described on source.android.com. The SensorHAL will
   be automatically build and installed into system.img


COMPILING THE SENSOR HAL FOR LINUX

   From From SensorHAL_IIO root folder set CROSS_COMPILE and ARCH environment
   variables accordingly to your target board, for example on HiKey board:

>     export ARCH=arm64
>     export CROSS_COMPILE=<binutils_path>/gcc-linaro-5.5.0-2017.10-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-

   Then use Makefile to build:

      make

   Linux library (.so) will be produced in HAL root directory, please copy
   SensorHAL and libsensoriioutils shared object to your standard /lib or
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH target filesystem.

SENSORS SUPPORTED:
   - ST Test sensors		(Accel + Magn + Gyro);
   - ASM330LHH			(Accel + Gyro)
   - ASM330LHHX			(Accel + Gyro)

CHANGELOG:
   v3.0.0: First HAL revision
   v3.1.1: Added injection mode, changed way to decimate sensor data
   v3.1.2: Bugfix on flush propagation
   v3.1.3: Fixed compiling issue on Android L and K (wrist-tilt)
   v3.1.4: Added support for ASM330LHH
   v3.1.5: Added support for Android N. Added support for different kernel versions
   v3.1.6: Add support to Android O
   v3.1.7: Move iio_utils in separated shared library
   v3.1.8: Reworked library and removed dead code
